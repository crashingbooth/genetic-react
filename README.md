# Pattern Evolution

This project applies simple genetic algorithms to evolve percussion patterns. It is built with React using Tone.js, and is inspired by the [GenJam](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/GenJam-Duple) model included with the [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml) application

## Try the model
